# Basics

_MongoDB can be secured probably if the following steps are followed:_

1. Authentication & authorization
   - users need to authenticate themselves
   - to use a database server
2. Transport encryption
   - that data which is send from the app to the server
   - should be encrypted that
   - nobody can interfere with the data
   - during the process
3. Encryption at rest
   - data in the database should be encrypted
   - so that nobody that gets access to the database
   - can see the most sensitive data
4. Auditing
   - for admins to see
   - which users performend which operations
5. Server and network configuration and setup
   - how to secure the network
   - where the MongoDB server is hosted
6. Backups & software updates
   - regularly backup data
   - software is updated to fix security issues
