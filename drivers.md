# Basics

Reference: https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/

MongoDB commands

- should not be only executable in a shell
- BUT also in an application to making changes against a database

This is made possible by MongoDB Drivers

- which are bridges between
- programming languages and
- the MongoDB server

In the drivers

- the same commands are used as in the shell,
- BUT adapted to the syntax of the respective programming language

# Example

The syntax of the MongoDB commands

- for the Node.js Driver
- looks very similar to the shell commands
